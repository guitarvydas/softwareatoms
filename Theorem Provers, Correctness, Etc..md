Proving the correctness of a program is only a tertiary problem.

The primary problem is `controlling a computer`.

Theorem provers cannot prove that a product meets the customers' requirements.

Theorem provers can only prove that programs do what the programmers intend.

The concept of matching program execution to programmer beliefs is an already-solved problem.  

For example, this can be done via manual methods.  Automating the methods using theorem provers is but an optimization - a reduction in cost.

In the very early days of SIRI, questions were sent directly to humans who provided answers.  Over time, this process was automated (cost reduced) by replacing many of the human answerers by computers.
